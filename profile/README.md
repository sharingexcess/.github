# Hey There! We're Sharing Excess, and we're building software to solve scarcity with surplus.

Sharing Excess is a nonprofit organization based in Philadelphia, PA. We work to fight food insecurity around the country by solving the last mile problem for surplus food from wholesale markets, grocery stores, and restaurants. We source, rescue, and redistribute food to local partners, and have delivered over 45,000,000 lbs. of food since 2018.

## Current Contributors

Tech @ Sharing Excess is a scrappy team of volunteers, students, and contributors working to build tools that make real impact. We work hard to build a community based on collaborative learning, constant exploration, and easy-to-read code that makes it easy for new folks to jump in and help.

## The SE Platform

Our tech platform consists of a number of data systems, servers, and web + mobile based clients that allow the SE team to rescue food around the clock, around the country. Here's a basic (and hopefully current) map of the system (updated May 2024):
